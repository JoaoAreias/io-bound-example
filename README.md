# io-bound-example
This repo is created to demonstrate how Python's multithreading can speed up IO-Bound operations.

While the Global Interpreter Lock prevents us from using threads to spead up CPU Bound operations in Python, we can still use threads to speed up IO-Bound Operations. This repo demonstrate an examle of how to do that.
